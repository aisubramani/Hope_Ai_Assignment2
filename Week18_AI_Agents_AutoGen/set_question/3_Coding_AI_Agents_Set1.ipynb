      "* Consider adding specific examples or statistics to illustrate the effects of global warming on climate patterns, ecosystems, and human life. This would help readers understand the severity of the problem.\n",
      "* The language is quite general; using more precise terms or phrases could enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of the statement.\n",

Rising temperatures are altering climate patterns, leading to extreme weather events such as intense hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. For instance, 2020 saw record-breaking heatwaves in Europe, Australia, and North America, resulting in devastating losses of life and property.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact on ecosystems is equally alarming. As global temperatures rise, many species are struggling to adapt, leading to a decline in biodiversity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), up to 1 million species face extinction due to human activities, with climate change being a primary driver. This not only has ecological consequences but also affects human well-being, as we rely on these ecosystems for food, water, and other essential resources.\n",

      "3. **Error message**: The error message raised when attempting to divide by zero is clear, but it might be more helpful to include a hint about what the user can do instead (e.g., \"Cannot divide by zero; please use a non-zero value for b\").\n",
